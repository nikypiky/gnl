The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate s
rings respectively. They are designed to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements for strncpy(3) and strncat(3). Unlike those functions, strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the buffer (not
just the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result (as long as size is larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long as there is at least one byte free in dst). Note that a byte for the NUL should be

ncluded in si
e. Also note that strlcpy() and strlcat() only operate on true ''C'' strings. This means that for strlcpy() src must b
NUL-terminated and for strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminatedhhk.
